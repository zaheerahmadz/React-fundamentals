// 1:props
// Props in React are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component to control its behavior or display.
// .
// .
// .
// 2:import types
// Named import/export default import/export
// .
// .
// .
// 3:hooks
// Hooks in React are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components without writing class components.
// .
// .
// .
// 4:useState
// when you want to hold the data and also want the re-render then us use useState hook
// const [Text, setText] = useState();
// .
// .
// .
// 5:useEffect
// useEffect is a React Hook that handles side effects (extra work) in a component.
// It is commonly used for data fetching, subscriptions, timers, and browser-related tasks.
// It runs after the component renders and can run on the first render or when specific data changes, depending on the dependency array.
// No array/////////After every render
// [] //////////////Only on first render
// [state]///////// its run when that state change
//.
//.
//.
//Conditional rendering
// Conditional rendering in React is a technique used to render different UI elements or components based on conditions such as state or props.
// Examples: Show a loader while data is fetching
//Display error messages if something fails
//Render different UI for logged-in vs logged-out users
//if (isLoading) {
//return <h2>Loading...</h2>;
//}

// return <h2>Data Loaded</h2>;
//.
//.
//.
// ShortCircuit
//Short-circuiting in React is a JavaScript technique that uses logical operators like && to conditionally render components based on a condition.
//const [text,setText] =useState('hello')
// const firstValue = text || "Hello World";
// const secondValue = text && "Hello World";
//.
//.
//.
// UseRef
//useRef is a React Hook that stores a mutable value which persists across renders and does not trigger a re-render when its value changes.
//const nameRef = useRef(initialValue);
//.
//.
//.
//Controlled inputs
//Controlled inputs are form inputs whose values are fully controlled by React state. This means the input’s value is stored in a state variable, and every change is handled through React.
//.
//.
//.
//DOM
//document object modal that means changing the content, structure, or style of a web page using JavaScript.
